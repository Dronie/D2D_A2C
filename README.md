# D2D A2C Code Repo
Channel Selection and Power Control for D2D Communication via Online Reinforcement Learning implementations

<strong>D2D_A2C_multi.py</strong> - benchmark code

<strong>D2D_A2C_multi_two_out.py</strong> - working code for dual policy distribution output model

<strong>D2D_A2C_multi_two_out_BN.py</strong> - same as "D2D_A2C_multi_two_out.py" bit using batch normalisation

<strong>D2D_A2C_multi_two_out_deeper.py</strong>- same as "D2D_A2C_multi_two_out.py" but with altered network architecture (best convergence performance)

<strong>D2D_env_discrete.py</strong> - environment simulation code (provdided by supervisor)
